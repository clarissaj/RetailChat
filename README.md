# RetailChat
An app that allows a retail employees to send messages when company policy allows as well as submit business cases for new inventory.

We use the mailcore api/framework which shows as a folder in our repo. Due to its huge size, github gave us issues uploading it, so you can get its contents using the following in terminal: git clone https://github.com/MailCore/mailcore2.git
